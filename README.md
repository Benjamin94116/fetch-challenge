### Focus Areas: 
UI Simplified: Breaking the UI into reusable component
API Integration â€“ Ensuring smooth data fetching and error handling.

### Time Spent: 
Approximately 5 hours were spent on the project.

### Trade-offs and Decisions: 
Quick styling instead of building custom UI components to save time.
Instead of adding filters and sorting options, the focus was on core functionalities to ensure stability

### Weakest Part of the Project: 
Scalability: The current implementation may not handle large datasets efficiently.
API Dependency: If the external API changes, it could break the application without proper error handling.

### Additional Information:
The app could be enhanced by adding search, filtering, and bookmarking features.
Implementing pagination layer could reduce API calls and improve performance.
